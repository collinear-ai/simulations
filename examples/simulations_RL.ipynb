It’s possible that exceeding your data limit by 100GB this month resulted in additional charges compared to last month’s overage. Pricing structures can vary based on the amount of data you exceed.

If you'd like, I can help you review your bill or look into the charges further.\n","USER: My previous bill was around $150, but this month's bill is $220 - that's a $70 increase, which seems like a big jump, especially considering I only used my phone for normal stuff, nothing out of the ordinary.\n","ASSISTANT: That does seem like a significant increase. The additional charges from exceeding your data limit can vary based on your plan and the rate for overages. It’s also possible that there could be other factors, like taxes or fees, that contributed to the increase.
