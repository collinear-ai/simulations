When the seat map loads, look for the aisle seats in row 17—those are usually labeled A or C. If an aisle seat is shown as available, tap it and the seat will be added to your order.

The best way to confirm whether the aisle seat in row 17 is truly unavailable is to reach out to the airline’s customer‑service team—either by phone, chat, or the “Help” option on their website. They can look up the exact seat assignment status and let you know if the seat can be released or if a different aisle seat can be offered.

Unfortunately, I don’t have access to the airline’s internal seat‑management system, so I can’t pull up the current status myself. The quickest way to see if the seat is truly unavailable—or if it can be released—is to call the airline’s reservation line or use their online chat. When you do, have your booking reference ready and ask specifically about aisle seats in row 17.
